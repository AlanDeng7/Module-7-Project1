# Module-7-Project1: Toronto vs Vancouver Restaurants
This project uses the Yelp API and Geoapify API to compare restaurants in Toronto and Vancouver. 
Using all the business data from the Yelp API, analysis were made from restaurant ratings, 
proximity to busier areas, restaurant preferences, types of restaurant, and hours of operation.
From the analysis, conclusions were made for each of the questions asked about these two cities.
